# WebCrawler
A News Web Scraper made using MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.
Here, I have scraped Times Of India website using cheerio. The functionality that I have provided are:-
  - list view - list down all the news from the scraped website.
  - search functionality - shows all the news containing the searched element (case insensitive search).
  - favourites - save the news you want to read later.
               - delete the saved news once read.
  - on refresh new data will be added if there is any change in website to be scraped.
You can scrape any website by changing the url.
